## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a reference describing the methods in the package in the description field of the DESCRIPTION file in the form
authors (year) <doi:...>
* Changed uses of T and F as logicals to TRUE and FALSE
* Reset the user's options() after changing them. This occurs only once, in the vignette.

## Release summary

This is the first release for CRAN.

## R CMD check results

Duration: 1m 12.7s

The only note is that this is a new submission. The word Lundberg in DESCRIPTION is my name and is spelled correctly.
